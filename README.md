For our report, we use the second_half.csv to do the preprocessing models. 

simplethreshold.Rmd shows the code of simple threshold model and confusion matrix with threshold 20, 
which has the better accuracy rate compare to other threhold value.

For testing different threshold value, need to manually change line 117 & 139
